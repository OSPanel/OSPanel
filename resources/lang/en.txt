INSTALLATION RECOMMENDATIONS:

DO NOT INSTALL the program on top of the existing version, it can destroy all existing databases, customized configs and other important information.

DO NOT INSTALL the program on USB flash drives (fast wear and extremely slow operation) and on external storage media with an old USB 2.0 interface (extremely slow operation).

IT IS RECOMMENDED to install the program on an SSD drive (if available), this will significantly increase the speed of operation of all modules of the software package.
