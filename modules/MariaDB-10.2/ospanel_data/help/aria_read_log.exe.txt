Display and apply log records from a Aria transaction log
found in the current directory (for now)

Note: Aria is compiled without -DIDENTICAL_PAGES_AFTER_RECOVERY
which means that the table files are not byte-to-byte identical to
files created during normal execution. This should be ok, except for
test scripts that tries to compare files before and after recovery.
