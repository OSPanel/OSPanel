mysqld.exe  Ver 5.5.68-MariaDB for Win64 on AMD64 (mariadb.org binary distribution)
Copyright (c) 2000, 2018, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.

Starts the MariaDB database server.

Usage: mysqld.exe [OPTIONS]
NT and Win32 specific options:
  --install                     Install the default service (NT).
  --install-manual              Install the default service started manually (NT).
  --install service_name        Install an optional service (NT).
  --install-manual service_name Install an optional service started manually (NT).
  --remove                      Remove the default service from the service list (NT).
  --remove service_name         Remove the service_name from the service list (NT).
  --enable-named-pipe           Only to be used for the default server (NT).
  --standalone                  Dummy option to start as a standalone server (NT).


Default options are read from the following files in the given order:
C:\Windows\my.ini C:\Windows\my.cnf C:\my.ini C:\my.cnf   
The following groups are read: mysqld server mysqld-5.5 mariadb mariadb-5.5 client-server
The following options may be given as the first argument:
--print-defaults          Print the program argument list and exit.
--no-defaults             Don't read default options from any option file.
The following specify which files/extra groups are read (specified before remaining options):
--defaults-file=#         Only read default options from the given file #.
--defaults-extra-file=#   Read this file after the global files are read.
--defaults-group-suffix=# Additionally read default groups with # appended as a suffix.

  --allow-suspicious-udfs 
                      Allows use of UDFs consisting of only one symbol xxx()
                      without corresponding xxx_init() or xxx_deinit(). That
                      also means that one can load any function from any
                      library, for example exit() from libc.so
  -a, --ansi          Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax. This mode
                      will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.
  --archive[=name]    Enable or disable ARCHIVE plugin. Possible values are ON,
                      OFF, FORCE (don't start if the plugin fails to load).
  --aria[=name]       Enable or disable Aria plugin. Possible values are ON,
                      OFF, FORCE (don't start if the plugin fails to load).
  --aria-block-size=# Block size to be used for Aria index pages.
  --aria-checkpoint-interval=# 
                      Interval between tries to do an automatic checkpoints. In
                      seconds; 0 means 'no automatic checkpoints' which makes
                      sense only for testing.
  --aria-checkpoint-log-activity=# 
                      Number of bytes that the transaction log has to grow
                      between checkpoints before a new checkpoint is written to
                      the log.
  --aria-force-start-after-recovery-failures=# 
                      Number of consecutive log recovery failures after which
                      logs will be automatically deleted to cure the problem; 0
                      (the default) disables the feature.
  --aria-group-commit=name 
                      Specifies Aria group commit mode. Possible values are
                      "none" (no group commit), "hard" (with waiting to actual
                      commit), "soft" (no wait for commit (DANGEROUS!!!))
  --aria-group-commit-interval=# 
                      Interval between commite in microseconds (1/1000000c). 0
                      stands for no waiting for other threads to come and do a
                      commit in "hard" mode and no sync()/commit at all in
                      "soft" mode.  Option has only an effect if
                      aria_group_commit is used
  --aria-log-dir-path=name 
                      Path to the directory where to store transactional log
  --aria-log-file-size=# 
                      Limit for transaction log size
  --aria-log-purge-type=name 
                      Specifies how Aria transactional log will be purged.
                      Possible values of name are "immediate", "external" and
                      "at_flush"
  --aria-max-sort-file-size=# 
                      Don't use the fast sort index method to created index if
                      the temporary file would get bigger than this.
  --aria-page-checksum 
                      Maintain page checksums (can be overridden per table with
                      PAGE_CHECKSUM clause in CREATE TABLE)
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-aria-page-checksum to disable.)
  --aria-pagecache-age-threshold=# 
                      This characterizes the number of hits a hot block has to
                      be untouched until it is considered aged enough to be
                      downgraded to a warm block. This specifies the percentage
                      ratio of that number of hits to the total number of
                      blocks in the page cache.
  --aria-pagecache-buffer-size=# 
                      The size of the buffer used for index blocks for Aria
                      tables. Increase this to get better index handling (for
                      all reads and multiple writes) to as much as you can
                      afford.
  --aria-pagecache-division-limit=# 
                      The minimum percentage of warm blocks in key cache
  --aria-recover[=name] 
                      Specifies how corrupted tables should be automatically
                      repaired. Possible values are one or more of "NORMAL"
                      (the default), "BACKUP", "FORCE", or "QUICK".
  --aria-repair-threads=# 
                      Number of threads to use when repairing Aria tables. The
                      value of 1 disables parallel repair.
  --aria-sort-buffer-size=# 
                      The buffer that is allocated when sorting the index when
                      doing a REPAIR or when creating indexes with CREATE INDEX
                      or ALTER TABLE.
  --aria-stats-method=name 
                      Specifies how Aria index statistics collection code
                      should treat NULLs. Possible values are "nulls_unequal",
                      "nulls_equal", and "nulls_ignored".
  --aria-sync-log-dir=name 
                      Controls syncing directory after log file growth and new
                      file creation. Possible values are "never", "newfile" and
                      "always").
  --auto-increment-increment[=#] 
                      Auto-increment columns are incremented by this
  --auto-increment-offset[=#] 
                      Offset added to Auto-increment columns. Used when
                      auto-increment-increment != 1
  --autocommit        Set default value for autocommit (0 or 1)
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-autocommit to disable.)
  --automatic-sp-privileges 
                      Creating and dropping stored procedures alters ACLs
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-automatic-sp-privileges to disable.)
  --back-log=#        The number of outstanding connection requests MySQL can
                      have. This comes into play when the main MySQL thread
                      gets very many connection requests in a very short time
  -b, --basedir=name  Path to installation directory. All paths are usually
                      resolved relative to this
  --big-tables        Allow big result sets by saving all temporary sets on
                      file (Solves most 'table full' errors)
  --bind-address=name IP address to bind to.
  --binlog-annotate-row-events 
                      Tells the master to annotate RBR events with the
                      statement that caused these events
  --binlog-cache-size=# 
                      The size of the transactional cache for updates to
                      transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
                      use transactions containing many statements, you can
                      increase this to get more performance
  --binlog-checksum=name 
                      Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
                      events in the binary log. Possible values are NONE and
                      CRC32; default is NONE.
  --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
                      Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
                      statement format to be written directly to binary log.
                      Before using this option make sure that there are no
                      dependencies between transactional and non-transactional
                      tables such as in the statement INSERT INTO t_myisam
                      SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, slaves may diverge
                      from the master.
  --binlog-do-db=name Tells the master it should log updates for the specified
                      database, and exclude all others not explicitly
                      mentioned.
  --binlog-format=name 
                      What form of binary logging the master will use: either
                      ROW for row-based binary logging, STATEMENT for
                      statement-based binary logging, or MIXED. MIXED is
                      statement-based binary logging except for those
                      statements where only row-based is correct: those which
                      involve user-defined functions (i.e. UDFs) or the UUID()
                      function; for those, row-based binary logging is
                      automatically used. If NDBCLUSTER is enabled and
                      binlog-format is MIXED, the format switches to row-based
                      and back implicitly per each query accessing an
                      NDBCLUSTER table
  --binlog-ignore-db=name 
                      Tells the master that updates to the given database
                      should not be logged to the binary log.
  --binlog-optimize-thread-scheduling 
                      Run fast part of group commit in a single thread, to
                      optimize kernel thread scheduling. On by default. Disable
                      to run each transaction in group commit in its own
                      thread, which can be slower at very high concurrency.
                      This option is mostly for testing one algorithm versus
                      the other, and it should not normally be necessary to
                      change it.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-optimize-thread-scheduling to disable.)
  --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
                      The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
                      bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
                      size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
  --binlog-stmt-cache-size=# 
                      The size of the statement cache for updates to
                      non-transactional engines for the binary log. If you
                      often use statements updating a great number of rows, you
                      can increase this to get more performance
  --blackhole[=name]  Enable or disable BLACKHOLE plugin. Possible values are
                      ON, OFF, FORCE (don't start if the plugin fails to load).
  --bootstrap         Used by mysql installation scripts.
  --bulk-insert-buffer-size=# 
                      Size of tree cache used in bulk insert optimisation. Note
                      that this is a limit per thread!
  --character-set-client-handshake 
                      Don't ignore client side character set value sent during
                      handshake.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-character-set-client-handshake to disable.)

                      After inserting delayed_insert_limit rows, the INSERT
                      DELAYED handler will check if there are any SELECT
                      statements pending. If so, it allows these to execute
                      before continuing
  --delayed-insert-timeout=#

  --expire-logs-days=# 
                      If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
                      expire_logs_days days; possible purges happen at startup
                      and at binary log rotation
  --external-locking  Use system (external) locking (disabled by default). 
                      With this option enabled you can run myisamchk to test
                      (not repair) tables while the MySQL server is running.

                      Change the algorithm of checksum for the whole of
                      datapage to 4-bytes word based. The original checksum is
                      checked after the new one. It may be slow for reading
                      page which has orginal checksum. Overwrite the page or
                      recreate the InnoDB database, if you want the entire
                      benefit for performance at once. #### Attention: The

  --innodb-use-atomic-writes 
                      Prevent partial page writes, via atomic writes (beta).
                      The option is used to prevent partial writes in case of a
                      crash/poweroff, as faster alternative to doublewrite
                      buffer. Currently this option works only on Linux only
                      with FusionIO device, and directFS filesystem.
  --innodb-use-fallocate 
                      Preallocate files fast, using operating system
                      functionality. On POSIX systems, posix_fallocate system

                      Use global innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit value.
                      (default: ON).
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-innodb-use-global-flush-log-at-trx-commit to disable.)
  --innodb-use-native-aio 
                      Use native AIO if supported on this platform.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-innodb-use-native-aio to disable.)

                      Print stacktrace on long semaphore wait (off by default
                      supported only on linux)
  --innodb-use-sys-malloc 
                      Use OS memory allocator instead of InnoDB's internal
                      memory allocator
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-innodb-use-sys-malloc to disable.)
  --innodb-use-sys-stats-table 
                      Enable to use SYS_STATS system table to store statistics
                      statically, And avoids to calculate statistics at every
                      first open of the tables. This option may make the
                      opportunities of update statistics less. So you should
                      use ANALYZE TABLE command intentionally.

                      Controls what join operations can be executed with join
                      buffers. Odd numbers are used for plain join buffers
                      while even numbers are used for linked buffers
  --keep-files-on-create 
                      Don't overwrite stale .MYD and .MYI even if no directory
                      is specified
  --key-buffer-size=# The size of the buffer used for index blocks for MyISAM
                      tables. Increase this to get better index handling (for
                      all reads and multiple writes) to as much as you can
                      afford
  --key-cache-age-threshold=# 
                      This characterizes the number of hits a hot block has to
                      be untouched until it is considered aged enough to be
                      downgraded to a warm block. This specifies the percentage
                      ratio of that number of hits to the total number of
                      blocks in key cache

                      the week.
  --local-infile      Enable LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-local-infile to disable.)

                      Timeout in seconds to wait for a lock before returning an
                      error.
  -l, --log[=name]    Log connections and queries to file (deprecated option,
                      use --general-log/--general-log-file instead).
  --log-basename=name Basename for all log files and the .pid file. This sets
                      all log file names at once (in 'datadir') and is normally
                      the only option you need for specifying log files. Sets
                      names for --log-bin, --log-bin-index, --relay-log,
                      --relay-log-index, --general-log-file,
                      --log-slow-query-log-file, --log-error-file, and
                      --pid-file
  --log-bin[=name]    Log update queries in binary format. Optional argument
                      should be name for binary log. If not given
                      'datadir'/'log-basename'-bin or 'datadir'/mysql-bin will
                      be used (the later if --log-basename is not specified).
                      We strongly recommend to use either --log-basename or
                      specify a filename to ensure that replication doesn't
                      stop if the real hostname of the computer changes.
  --log-bin-index=name 
                      File that holds the names for last binary log files.
  --log-bin-trust-function-creators 
                      If set to FALSE (the default), then when --log-bin is
                      used, creation of a stored function (or trigger) is
                      allowed only to users having the SUPER privilege and only
                      if this stored function (trigger) may not break binary
                      logging. Note that if ALL connections to this server
                      ALWAYS use row-based binary logging, the security issues
                      do not exist and the binary logging cannot break, so you
                      can safely set this to TRUE
  --log-error[=name]  Log errors to file (instead of stdout).  If file name is
                      not specified then 'datadir'/'log-basename'.err or the
                      'pid-file' path with extension .err is used
  --log-isam[=name]   Log all MyISAM changes to file.
  --log-output=name   Syntax: log-output=value[,value...], where "value" could
                      be TABLE, FILE or NONE

                      index to the slow log if it is open
  --log-short-format  Don't log extra information to update and slow-query
                      logs.
  --log-slave-updates Tells the slave to log the updates from the slave thread
                      to the binary log. You will need to turn it on if you
                      plan to daisy-chain the slaves
  --log-slow-admin-statements 
                      Log slow OPTIMIZE, ANALYZE, ALTER and other
                      administrative statements to the slow log if it is open.
  --log-slow-filter=name 
                      Log only certain types of queries. Multiple flags can be
                      specified, separated by commas. Valid values are admin,
                      slave, filesort, filesort_on_disk, full_join, full_scan,
                      query_cache, query_cache_miss, tmp_table,
                      tmp_table_on_disk
  --log-slow-queries[=name] 
                      Enable logging of slow queries (longer than
                      --long-query-time) to log file or table. Optional
                      argument is a file name for the slow log. If not given,
                      'log-basename'-slow.log will be used. Use
                      --log-output=TABLE if you want to have the log in the
                      table mysql.slow_log. Deprecated option, use
                      --slow-query-log/--slow-query-log-file instead.
  --log-slow-rate-limit=# 
                      Write to slow log every #th slow query. Set to 1 to log
                      everything. Increase it to reduce the size of the slow or

                      Controls the heuristic(s) applied during query
                      optimization to prune less-promising partial plans from
                      the optimizer search space. Meaning: 0 - do not apply any
                      heuristic, thus perform exhaustive search; 1 - prune
                      plans based on number of retrieved rows
  --optimizer-search-depth=# 
                      Maximum depth of search performed by the query optimizer.
                      Values larger than the number of relations in a query
                      result in better query plans, but take longer to compile
                      a query. Values smaller than the number of tables in a
                      relation result in faster optimization, but may produce
                      very bad query plans. If set to 0, the system will
                      automatically pick a reasonable value; if set to 63, the
                      optimizer will switch to the original find_best search.

                      SET foo='bar' while having selected a different or no
                      database. If you need cross database updates to work,
                      make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
  --replicate-do-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      specified table. To specify more than one table, use the
                      directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
                      work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-do-db.
  --replicate-events-marked-for-skip=name 
                      Whether the slave should replicate events that were
                      created with @@skip_replication=1 on the master. Default
                      REPLICATE (no events are skipped). Other values are
                      FILTER_ON_SLAVE (events will be sent by the master but
                      ignored by the slave) and FILTER_ON_MASTER (events marked
                      with @@skip_replication=1 will be filtered on the master
                      and never be sent to the slave).
  --replicate-ignore-db=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
                      database. To specify more than one database to ignore,
                      use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
                      This option will not work if you use cross database
                      updates. If you need cross database updates to work, make
                      sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%. 
  --replicate-ignore-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
                      table. To specify more than one table to ignore, use the
                      directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
                      work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-ignore-db.
  --replicate-rewrite-db=name 
                      Updates to a database with a different name than the
                      original. Example:
                      replicate-rewrite-db=master_db_name->slave_db_name.
  --replicate-same-server-id 
                      In replication, if set to 1, do not skip events having
                      our server id. Default value is 0 (to break infinite
                      loops in circular replication). Can't be set to 1 if
                      --log-slave-updates is used.
  --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
                      specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
                      times, once for each table. This will work for
                      cross-database updates. Example:
                      replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
                      updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
                      and whose table names start with bar.
  --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables
                      that match the given wildcard pattern. To specify more
                      than one table to ignore, use the directive multiple
                      times, once for each table. This will work for
                      cross-database updates. Example:
                      replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar% will not do updates
                      to tables in databases that start with foo and whose
                      table names start with bar.
  --report-host=name  Hostname or IP of the slave to be reported to the master
                      during slave registration. Will appear in the output of
                      SHOW SLAVE HOSTS. Leave unset if you do not want the
                      slave to register itself with the master. Note that it is
                      not sufficient for the master to simply read the IP of
                      the slave off the socket once the slave connects. Due to
                      NAT and other routing issues, that IP may not be valid
                      for connecting to the slave from the master or other
                      hosts
  --report-password=name

  --report-port=#     Port for connecting to slave reported to the master
                      during slave registration. Set it only if the slave is
                      listening on a non-default port or if you have a special
                      tunnel from the master or other clients to the slave. If
                      not sure, leave this option unset
  --report-user=name  The account user name of the slave to be reported to the
                      master during slave registration
  --rowid-merge-buff-size=#

                      of replication partners
  --shared-memory     Enable the shared memory
  --shared-memory-base-name=name 
                      Base name of shared memory
  --show-slave-auth-info 
                      Show user and password in SHOW SLAVE HOSTS on this
                      master.
  --skip-bdb          Deprecated option; Exist only for compatiblity with old
                      my.cnf files
  --skip-grant-tables Start without grant tables. This gives all users FULL
                      ACCESS to all tables.
  --skip-host-cache   Don't cache host names.
  --skip-name-resolve Don't resolve hostnames. All hostnames are IP's or
                      'localhost'.
  --skip-networking   Don't allow connection with TCP/IP
  --skip-show-database 
                      Don't allow 'SHOW DATABASE' commands
  --skip-slave-start  If set, slave is not autostarted.
  --skip-thread-priority 
                      Don't give threads different priorities. This option is
                      deprecated because it has no effect; the implied behavior
                      is already the default.

                      IDEMPOTENT mode, replication will not stop for operations
                      that are idempotent. In STRICT mode, replication will
                      stop on any unexpected difference between the master and
                      the slave
  --slave-load-tmpdir=name

  --slave-skip-errors=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to continue replication when a
                      query event returns an error from the provided list
  --slave-sql-verify-checksum 
                      Force checksum verification of replication events after
                      reading them from relay log. Note: Events are always
                      checksum-verified by slave on receiving them from the
                      network before writing them to the relay log
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-slave-sql-verify-checksum to disable.)
  --slave-transaction-retries=# 
                      Number of times the slave SQL thread will retry a
                      transaction in case it failed with a deadlock or elapsed
                      lock wait timeout, before giving up and stopping
  --slave-type-conversions=name 
                      Set of slave type conversions that are enabled. Legal
                      values are: ALL_LOSSY to enable lossy conversions and
                      ALL_NON_LOSSY to enable non-lossy conversions. If the
                      variable is assigned the empty set, no conversions are
                      allowed and it is expected that the types match exactly.
  --slow-launch-time=# 
                      If creating the thread takes longer than this value (in
                      seconds), the Slow_launch_threads counter will be
                      incremented
  --slow-query-log    Log slow queries to a table or log file. Defaults logging
                      to a file 'hostname'-slow.log or a table mysql.slow_log

                      for the desired number of threads that should be run at
                      the same time.This variable has no effect, and is
                      deprecated. It will be removed in a future release.
  --thread-handling=name
