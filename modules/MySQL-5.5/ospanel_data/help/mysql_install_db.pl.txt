Usage: mysql_install_db.pl [OPTIONS]
  --basedir=path       The path to the MySQL installation directory.
  --builddir=path      If using --srcdir with out-of-directory builds, you
                       will need to set this to the location of the build
                       directory where built files reside.
  --cross-bootstrap    For internal use.  Used when building the MySQL system
                       tables on a different host than the target.
  --datadir=path       The path to the MySQL data directory.
  --defaults-extra-file=name
                       Read this file after the global files are read.
  --defaults-file=name Only read default options from the given file name.
  --force              Causes mysql_install_db to run even if DNS does not
                       work.  In that case, grant table entries that
                       normally use hostnames will use IP addresses.
  --help               Display this help and exit.                     
  --ldata=path         The path to the MySQL data directory. Same as --datadir.
  --no-defaults        Don't read default options from any option file.
  --rpm                For internal use.  This option is used by RPM files
                       during the MySQL installation process.
  --skip-name-resolve  Use IP addresses rather than hostnames when creating
                       grant table entries.  This option can be useful if
                       your DNS does not work.
  --srcdir=path        The path to the MySQL source directory.  This option
                       uses the compiled binaries and support files within the
                       source tree, useful for if you don't want to install
                       MySQL yet and just want to create the system tables.
  --user=user_name     The login username to use for running mysqld.  Files
                       and directories created by mysqld will be owned by this
                       user.  You must be root to use this option.  By default
                       mysqld runs using your current login name and files and
                       directories that it creates will be owned by you.

All other options are passed to the mysqld program
